# New-Year-Sale-Project

Welcome to my Project entitled "New Year Sale". It is going to be my first project that helped me learn the fundamentals of Python as a beginner.

A few important libraries under Python are covered in the Project, i.e.,  numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib.

The datasheet used to propagate this assignment is included here, while step-by-step instructions about how data should be approached are given in the Jupyter Notebook.

Post completion of the given instructions, there is ample opportunity for you to further explore the data and come up with other exciting conclusions from your end.
